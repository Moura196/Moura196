# FullStack Developer
   - ### About me:
     - I am currently studying Systems Analysis and Development at Senai-SC, focus on becoming a Web and Mobile Full Stack developer. And I am about to start a specialization course focus on Java technology at UTFPR to get a better knowledge of what I can do with this programming language.  
     - Also I am studying Fullstack Developer TQI Bootcamp at the DIO platform, which you can see my progress at my [repository](#repository).  
     - If you want to know more about my journey you can visit my [blog](https://moura196.github.io/Moura196/) that I've created with Github Pages.
    
    
    I am a student of System Analysis and Development and I have graduated as Environmental and Sanitary Engineering at 2021.  
    I really enjoy studying to get prepare to apply everthing that I think it is important to make the world better.  
    That means that I am trying to build a path where I believe that my work will influence for the best.  
    As I am in a career transitioning I still figuring out how I can link both knowledge, but for now I understand that I can  
    use agile methods to make system developing process get faster, resulting use less resources use. I need to study more about  
    the vast field of frameworks of the technology that I currently using (Java and React.js) to have better efficiency.
