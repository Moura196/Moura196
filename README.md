# FullStack Developer
   - ### About me:
    I am a student of System Analysis and Development and I have graduated as Environmental and Sanitary Engineering at 2021.  
    I really enjoy studying to get prepare to apply everthing that I think it is important to make the world better.  
    That means that I am trying to build a path where I believe that my work will influence for the best.  
    As I am in a career transitioning I still figuring out how I can link both knowledge, but for now I understand that I can  
    use agile methods to make system developing process get faster, resulting use less resources use. I need to study more about  
    the vast field of frameworks of the technology that I currently using (Java and React.js) to have better efficiency.
