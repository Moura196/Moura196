# Understanding GitFlow: A Practical Guide to Better Project Management
Have you ever worked on a team project where the Git history was a chaotic mess? It can be difficult to manage new features, bug fixes, and releases all at once. That's where GitFlow comes in. GitFlow is a branching model that provides a clear and structured way to manage your project's development workflow.

In this guide, we'll explore the core concepts of GitFlow and show how it can help you and your team work more efficiently.

### The Two Main Branches  
At its heart, GitFlow relies on two main branches that exist for the life of the project:

- main: This branch always contains a production-ready version of the code. Every commit on main should be a new, stable release.

- develop: This branch is where all development happens. New features are merged into this branch before they are ready to be released.

### The Supporting Branches
To keep the main branches clean, GitFlow uses a few temporary, supporting branches:

- feature branches: These branches are created from develop to build a new feature. Once the feature is complete, it is merged back into develop. They should be named something like feature/my-new-feature.

- release branches: When develop has enough new features to form a new release, a release branch is created from it. This branch is used for final bug fixes and preparing for a new version. Once stable, it is merged into both main (for the new release) and develop (to ensure develop is up to date). They should be named release/1.2.0.

- hotfix branches: These branches are used to quickly fix critical bugs in the production version. They are created directly from main and, once the fix is applied, are merged back into both main and develop. They should be named hotfix/fix-critical-bug.

### A Typical GitFlow Workflow
Let's walk through a simple example of how GitFlow works:

1. A developer creates a new feature branch from develop.

2. They work on the feature and make their commits.

3. Once the feature is complete, they merge it back into develop.

4. When it's time for a new release, a release branch is created from develop.

5. Minor bugs are fixed on the release branch.

6. The release branch is merged into both main (as the new production release) and develop.

7. Finally, if a critical bug is found on production, a hotfix branch is created from main, fixed, and then merged back into both main and develop.

This process ensures that your main branch always remains stable and that development happens in an organized, predictable way.

### Comandos GitFlow
Here are some common Git commands you'll use:
#### - Iniciar gitflow: (mapeia as branch e cria a main e develop)  
    git flow init  
#### - Inicializa a branch feature:  
    git flow feature start <nome_issue_funcionalidade>  
#### - Finaliza a branch feature:  
    git flow feature finish <nome_issue_funcionalidade>  
#### - Inicializa a branch release:  
    git flow release start <tag -> 0.1.0>  
#### - Finaliza a branch release:  
    git flow release finish <tag -> 0.1.0>  
#### - Inicializa a branch hotfix:  
    git flow hotfix start <tag -> 0.0.1>  
#### - Finaliza a branch hotfix:  
    git flow hotfix finish <tag -> 0.0.1>  

### Why Use GitFlow?  
GitFlow provides a structured and disciplined approach to software development. It makes it easier to track what's ready for production, what's in development, and what's being prepared for release. This can significantly reduce confusion and errors, especially for larger teams.

It's a powerful methodology, but it's important to understand it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. For smaller projects or teams, a simpler model like GitHub Flow might be a better fit.
