I am a student of System Analysis and Development and I have graduated as Environmental and Sanitary Engineering at 2021. I really enjoy studying to get prepare to apply everthing that I think it is important to make the world better. That means that I am trying to build a path where I believe that my work will influence for the best.  
As I am in a career transitioning I still figuring out how I can link both knowledge, but for now I understand that I can use agile methods to make system developing process get faster, resulting in decreased resource usage. I need to study more about the vast field of frameworks of the technology that I currently using (Java and React.js) to have better efficiency.  
I hope you have an affinity of what I'm trying to show and that we stay in touch from now on.
